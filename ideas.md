# Ramya's Project Ideas

I started this list back in high school as a list on my whiteboard. It stayed up so long that I couldn't erase it when I was cleaning it so I decided to host my list on GitHub. Some of these might be dumb, but I hope to implement some version of each in the future. Hosting on GitHub allows people to take inspiration from my ideas which I hope will be of use in the future. 


## The List

- Programmable LED mask
	- Partially based off a costume I made in middle school and inspiration from the mascot of FRC Team 1425 during FIRST Power Up
	- An LED mask that could be programmed to show whatever you wanted on it, similar to the LED graduation cap and the LED top hat from Reddit
- Todoist Synchronization with Google Calendar
	- In the years, I've used Todoist, I have not found such a feature
	- It may exist already but having this would be a godsend
- Translation App for Important Documents
	- People who come to United States that can't speak English still need to do things like taxes or taking medicine, some kind of app for their phone that could translate information correctly that they can be safe
		- Privacy concerns with such an app with OCR being in the cloud 
- NLP Kids Bop Song Generator
	- Based on a comment by Sidd Srinivasa, professor of the Personal Robotics Lab
	- NLP to interpret any PG13+ content and a neural network to generate kid friendly replacement for each?
		- Perhaps a project after I learn what NLP is
